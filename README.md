# Works
This project uses a 8x8 LED screen connected to arduino and a set of buttons to move in the game.
When the C program starts running and arduino is connected to the system C file works as a main menu for the gameboy choosing which game to play or close.
After a choice has been made arduino recieves the data and starts the game when the game is finished sends the finished info back to C program and goes back to main menu.
